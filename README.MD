## INTRODUCTION

The objective is to aggregate data from various motorcycle brands by sourcing information from over five distinct motorcycle craft websites. This initiative aims to provide comprehensive insights and facilitate informed decision-making within the industry.

## CHALLENGE

During the data aggregation process, I faced significant challenges due to the large volume of information available across multiple websites. The extensive scraping efforts required considerable time and resulted in substantial file sizes. Additionally, certain websites implemented measures to block IP addresses in an attempt to prevent scraping, complicating the data collection process further.

## SOLUTION

To address these challenges, I utilized multiple servers in conjunction with proxies and VPNs to facilitate efficient data scraping. I organized the collected data by dividing it into separate files based on brands and models. After completing the scraping process, I merged these files into a comprehensive single dataset, ensuring an organized and streamlined data structure for further analysis.
